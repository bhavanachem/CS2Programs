# Snake Game in C++

This is a classic **Snake Game** built in C++ using the console. The game features the snake moving around the screen, eating fruits, and growing longer. The game ends when the snake collides with its own tail.

## Features

- **Gameplay**: The snake moves around the board, collects fruits, and grows longer with each fruit eaten.
- **Controls**: Use **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** to control the direction of the snake (Up, Left, Down, Right).
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The more fruits you collect, the longer the snake becomes, making the game more challenging.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with its own tail.
- **Score**: Each fruit eaten gives you points, and your score is displayed at the bottom of the game board.
